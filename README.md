# Orthogonal Convolution using System Verilog
### This project was to Demonstrate The working of Orthogonal Convolution in simplified manner

>Here is the table of 4bit signal used to convert orthogonal 6bit signal

| 4 bit Signal | 6 bit Signal |
| -----------  | -----------  |
| 4'b1000      | 6'b000111    |
| 4'b0110      | 6'b111000    |
| 4'b1100      | 6'b011100    |
